# APIs

## Firebase OAuth

Allows for multiple Auth Providers as well as email. Built by Google.

##  Stripe Payment Gateway

We intend to use react-stripe-elements to embed PCI compliant payment form components. These elements are generated by stripe but may be styled locally 

## Twitter API

The twitter and the twit npm packages both allow crud operations against an  account. Our usage here is more for proof of concept


#  Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

ðŸš«These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_authDomain - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_databaseURL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_projectID - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_storageBucket - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_messagingSenderId - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_API - this is your public Stripe API key, generated in the Stripe dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_backendURL - optional for your local development server
    *  REACT_APP_clientid - this is the Stripe_connect clientID, generated in Stripe_connect settings
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_plan - this is the ID for a second Stripe subscription plan, generated under Stripe products
